You will be given a text that contains information about various publications. Your task is to extract the publications from this text and create a list of JSON objects with the keys "author", "title", "year", and "doi".

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully read through the text and identify each distinct publication mentioned.

2. For each publication, extract the following information:
   - Author(s)
   - Title of the publication
   - Year of publication
   - Venue of publication
   - DOI (Digital Object Identifier)

3. Create a JSON object for each publication with the following structure:
   {
     "author": "Author name(s)",
     "title": "Title of the publication",
     "year": "Year of publication",
     "venue": "Venue of publication",
     "doi": "DOI of the publication"
   }

4. If any of the required information is missing for a publication, use the following guidelines:
   - For missing authors, use "Unknown" as the value.
   - For missing titles, use "Untitled" as the value.
   - For missing venues, use "N/A" as the value.
   - For missing years, use "N/A" as the value.
   - For missing DOIs, use "N/A" as the value.

5. Compile all the JSON objects into a list.

6. Present your output as a formatted list of JSON objects, with each object on a new line and properly indented.

Here's an example of how your output should look:

<output>
[
  {
    "author": "John Smith",
    "title": "An Analysis of AI Applications",
    "year": "2022",
    "venue": "Nature",
    "doi": "10.1234/abcd.5678"
  },
  {
    "author": "Jane Doe",
    "title": "Machine Learning Techniques",
    "year": "2021",
    "venue": "PNAS"
    "doi": "N/A"
  }
]
</output>

Make sure to include all publications mentioned in the text, even if some information is missing. Provide your final list of JSON objects directly without any enclosing tags.
